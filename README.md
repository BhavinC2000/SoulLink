# Pokemon Soul Link Pair Tracker

This application is a useful tool for Pokemon trainers who play want to try playing a Soul Link version of Pokemon.

If you are not familiar with the rules of a Soul Link, go to this link: https://pokemon-soul-link.fandom.com/wiki/Pokemon_Soul_Link_Wiki

This program allows teams to keep track of what Pokemon pairs have been caught already, what types they do/don't have, and what routes they have visited. There is also a region selecter, allowing the list of routes to change depending on which game the team decides to play.

How to add Pairs:
1. Enter the Pokemons' name or Pokedex number into the input boxes.
2. Select the respective genders of the pokemon ("Male <--> Female" or "Female <--> Male").
3. Select the route where you encountered that pair.
4. Click "Create Pair".

Adding a pair generates a button underneath the "Pairs" header, showing the names, types, and genders of the new pair. Additionally, once a pair is created, the types associated with those Pokemon are removed from the "Available Types" list (found below the "Create Pair" button). And finally, once a pair is created, the associated route that was selected becomes highlighted green, indicating that it has already been selected.

How to remove Pairs:
1. Find the pair you want to remove under the "Pairs" header.
2. Click on the particular pair.

To help with understanding, the interface comes with a little console that provides messages to the user, informing them of what is happening. For example, if the pair was made successfully, the console will display "Congratulations!! A new pair!!". If not, the console will display a message telling the user what the issue was.

Good luck!
